3.7 VM Instances

Create a script that does the following:
Create a firewall rule for TCP port 3000
Add the target tag ‘chat’
Create a VM instance
in zone ‘europe-west1-b’ with 1 CPU, approximately 4 GB of RAM, Ubuntu 22.04
Add a tag ‘chat’
Use an inline startup script to install the “Rocket Chat” server. Use ‘snaps’ for the installation. (If you don’t know what a ‘snap’ is, look it up).
The rocketchat server needs access on port 3000.
If the parameter ‘-d’ or ‘--delete’ is provided at the command line, remove the VM(s) and the firewall rule (script name: pract7.sh). The firewall rule should only be deleted when you delete the last instance making use of that tag.
If the firewall rule exists, output an appropriate message.
